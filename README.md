# carrot-color-picker
 A color picker based on the hsv color model. The website can be found at this [link](https://taseena09.github.io/carrot-color-picker/).

 The code base is extremely jank and repeats itself alot. A color pallete feature will be added alongside a refactor, so the codebase is not so jank.
